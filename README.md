If you have any problems, feedback or anything else, please let us know in Discord. (https://discord.lucid-hub.de)


# What should it do?

- It should show you in a simplified way what you can do in the cmd.
- It should have cool tools that can help you to get to know the cmd more quickly.

# Who can use it?

- Anyone can use it as long as it doesn't violate any laws!
- I think it's great if you change something in the code and upload it yourself, but not 1:1.

# How can I get help?

- Through our Discord Support Team. (https://discord.lucid-hub.de)
- Via email support. (hilfe@hexnrik.de)
- Otherwise everything else where you can reach me.
